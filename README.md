## Summary

The company expects a "silver tsunami" of retirement in the near future. 72,458 positions are currently filled by employees who were born between 1952 adn 1955. A breakdown of the positions is shown in one of the tables above.

There will be a need for mentors to help foster new employees into the roles that will be left vacant by the "silver tsunami". The company considers an employee born in 1965 as eligible to be a mentor. Above has a table of the number of employees born in 1965 and their titles. The number of employees eligible to be mentors is considerably smaller than the number retiring. The company will need to rethink it's mentorship criteria and find other ways to address the "silver tsunami".
